Category Overload provides an alternate administrative interface for managing categories in WordPress. If you've got a lot of categories this interface may work better for you.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Put the 'category-overload.php' file into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for Category Overload.


== Usage ==

When managing categories in your WordPress admin interface, Category Overload shows only one level of categories and only 50 per level at a time (paged). It replaces the standard category management interface for WordPress.

Click on a category to see the categories under that category.


== Known Issues ==

Minimum required version: WordPress 2.1.
